# Dartboard detection using OpenCV 
This project is a part of COMS30121 Image Processing and Computer Vision in University of Bristol. 

This project involves using OpenCV and Python to detect dartboard in images (2D). The project mainly focuses on using Hough transforms to detect line and circles in Hough Space and using weighting algorithm to determine which images contain dartboard and specify where in the image the dartboard is located. 

How to Run: 
> install using pip3 install opencv-python

> run dartboard.py
